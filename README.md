## City Data Portal Conversion

### This repo is testing only so far. Trying to clean up KML data out of the City of Sacramento Data Portal.

### What files do what:
1. xml2csv.py: html convert to CSV. Extracts tables.

2. kml2csv.py: kml convert to CSV. Does not do much yet.

3. jrcsv2gncsv.py  converts from the klm like hierarchical csv format used by junar open data platform 
to a flat csv format. The script reads in a junar csv and emits a standard csv, paths given by fnamein and fnameout
Code tested with Sacramento Cites locations-of-city-trees.csv and PARKI-SPACE.csv

4. scparkicsv2mysql.py  Builds and loads a mysql table from the CSV file generated by jrcsv2gncsv.py for parking data, field types are set appropriately for  parking space data set.  

5. sactreescsv2mysql.py Builds and loads a mysql table from the CSV file generated by jrcsv2gncsv.py for local tree data, field types are set appropriately for  tree  data set.
